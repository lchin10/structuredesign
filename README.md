## Overview

This is a website that helps University of Sydney Civil Engineering students to test their truss cross-section designs.
Based on certain inputted criterias, a visualization of the cross-section is created, along with the minimum number of rebars required to hold the stirrup in place.
The moment load and shear force designs are created, providing more information on the truss' stability and safety.

Thanks to Prof. Daniel Dias-Da-Costa and graduate student Zihao Liu for guiding me through this project.
